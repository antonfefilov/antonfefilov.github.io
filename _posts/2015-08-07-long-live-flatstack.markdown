Today I left FS.

Nostalgia. I sit and look at the latest Github's
commits and at the latest posts in the corporate chat. At the list of people, to
a farewell greetings from colleagues. All they are nice people and smart engineers.
These guys taught me programming, here I was promoted from junior to of middle.

Sad a bit, because I know, after a few minutes
I'm going to close the chat application and delete it from my laptop.
And then, after a while, access to the company's chat, as to the other corporate
applications will be restricted for me and my corporate account will be deleted.

For me it's the sunset of another one, very important and difficult, but at the same
time extremely interesting stage of my life.

2 years and 1 month. 761 day, I learned
**Ruby**, **Ruby on Rails**, **Javascript**, **CSS** and **HTML**, learned about **patterns of
object-oriented design** and **refactoring**,  touched the **BDD/TDD**, made my first application
with **Ember.js** and began to move toward **Golang**. The programming world extremely changed since
I dealt with it at the beginning of 2000-th and it's a good time to dive into it more deeply, so ...

... au revoir Flatstack, good morning new age of my life ...
